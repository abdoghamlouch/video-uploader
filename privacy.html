  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: July 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal credentials (usernames, passwords). The Extension uses OAuth to obtain access tokens from third-party services (YouTube, TikTok) solely to perform uploads you initiate.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Access tokens are held in Chrome’s secure storage and used only to call the official APIs on your behalf. We do not share or sell these tokens or any usage data.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Extension interacts directly with YouTube’s and TikTok’s APIs. Your data is subject to their privacy policies as well.</p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>The Extension does not use cookies. Any settings or tokens are stored locally in your browser’s extension storage and are not transmitted to our servers.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Your OAuth tokens remain stored in your browser until you remove the Extension or revoke access via your Google or TikTok account settings.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We follow industry best practices for securing OAuth flows. However, no method is totally secure—use the Extension at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
